Way up in the sky
There used to be a heartbeat
A full of the folly, so-called civilization
It’s only me who knows that
It’s hideous yet splendid
The animas you broke and left to live
The sky is tore down
Like it was an answer
Cuz so beautifully done and fallen
It was your answer
Who wanna take it back when the end teaches
emotions?
Your breath taught me an ancient law of life
From miles away
Flew to tell you how this world you sacrificed
To save me
Is shining in my eyes to show in your eyes
But found out it was only a dream
Blinks taken away
Wish you heard me in here, an empty voice
"To save me"
Is shining in my eyes to drop in your eyes
Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your
answer
Those words that you gave me
I’ll carve them to my core
It’s me myself who can tell how it’s ended and
started
So I’m just singing aloud to you
Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your
answer
The whole world with the order
Not yet elucidated
It’s me myself who can tell how it’s enchanted
So I’m just singing alone to you
Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your
answer, darling
A fairy tale about the dystopia
Has come true like the mother’s kindness
The lives we lived the memories we have left,
the Chronicle we walked along
In 2099, we realized
We were not the first to reach the end
The sunshine gently holds me tight and tight
Makes me feel like an eternity
From miles away
Flew to find you, how this put an end to you
Like magic
It gulps you down, drowned in the line
And yet the sun comes from your place
Blinks taken away
Wish you heard me in here, an empty voice
"To save me"
Is shining in my eyes to drop in your eyes
Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your
answer
Those words that you gave me
I’ll carve them to my core
It’s me myself who can tell how it’s ended and
started
So I’m just singing aloud to you
Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your
answer
When your soul remembers
To love something once more
May you embrace it, never ever let it hurt you
So I’m just singing aloud to you
Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your
answer, darling
